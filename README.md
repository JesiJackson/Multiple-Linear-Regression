## 🚖 New York Yellow Taxi Trip Analysis – Multiple Linear Regression

This project focuses on using **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict the duration of yellow taxi trips in New York City. The dataset includes features such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, and pickup time. The goal is to understand the main factors that influence trip duration and build a predictive model.

### 📈 Results Summary

* Achieved an **R² score of 0.84**, indicating a strong fit of the model to the data.
* Key predictors of trip duration included **trip distance** and **pickup hour**.
* Data preprocessing, including outlier removal and scaling, significantly improved model performance.
* The results demonstrate that a linear model can provide good predictions for this dataset, though more advanced models may offer further improvements.
